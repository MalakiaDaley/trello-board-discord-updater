# trello-board-discord-updater
This will send updates to your discord server when there's a new trello card added to the board you can configure this however you want. I'll maybe edit this in future but right now this is extremely barebones. I believe locking this feature behind paywall is insanely stupid and greedy.

Also for the trello developers I love you but please fix the backend api why is one your requests longer than a paragraph I'd write in an exam. Straight up BULLYING.
